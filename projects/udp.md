## UDP (Unified Data Platform) 
UDP (Unified Data Platform) provides a comprehensive solution for designing and deploying big data pipelines, along with additional features for efficient management. It abstracts infrastructure complexities, enabling UDP users to focus on their core tasks, such as creating ETL jobs and deploying them on managed Airflow. In my role as a team lead, I was responsible for ensuring the timely delivery of sprint commitments without any escalations.

- Designed and implemented core backend features for an ETL data pipeline project, including fault-tolerant APIs, Notebook APIs, and Airflow integration to provide deep insights into running jobs and pipelines within orchestration platforms. Resolved critical production issues within strict SLAs.

- Automated testing for complex end-to-end ETL use cases, significantly reducing manual testing efforts.

- Ensured code quality by integrating SonarQube into CI/CD pipelines, effectively eliminating P1 issues and mitigating security vulnerabilities across multiple code repositories. Increased code coverage from 10% to 80% while optimizing code to minimize OWASP vulnerabilities.
